// Editing `app.json` — the one file in a shared app that both a person and this server write.
//
// Everything here exists because of that shared ownership. The file holds the roster and the
// public settings; the author edits it by hand and commits it; and two of MulmoTerminal's own
// steps have to change one key in it (the generated `aid`, and the URL slug that was actually
// reserved). So a write here is never "produce the file" — it is "change one key of the file
// somebody else is keeping", which is why it reads, mutates, and replaces rather than rendering.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing, and each was a review finding before it was a rule:
//
//   - **atomic.** `writeFile` truncates first, so a failure part-way leaves a half-written
//     declaration — and nothing here could put back the roster it destroyed. Write beside it and
//     rename; a reader sees the old file or the new one.
//   - **the author's file, not ours.** The mode is preserved (a manifest kept at 0600 must not
//     come back 0644), a symlink is followed to the file it points at rather than replaced, and
//     every key the author wrote is carried through untouched.
//   - **one writer at a time.** Read-mutate-write is three steps; two callers interleaving them
//     both see the old file and one write is lost. Serialized on the RESOLVED path, because two
//     spellings of one root are one file.
