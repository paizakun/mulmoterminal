// line stream from decision-scan.ts and the tail reader from codex-rollout.ts now live together,
// so a reader picks one instead of writing a third. The third is the byte-range fold a reader uses
// when it will come BACK to the same growing file — reading it whole every time is cheap enough to
// miss until fifty of them are read on every request (#1377).
